# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a game in which your goal is to 'clear the minefield'. You start off by left-clicking one of the cells. Some of the cells have a bomb. Once a cell has been 'detonated', if it had a bomb, you lose. If not, it shows how many of the adjacent cells (diagonal included) have bombs in it. If none, all surrounding cells will automatically be detonated.

In my game, you **left-click** to detonate, and **right-click** to flag. To flag is to mark a cell which you think is a bomb. At the end of the game, if you win, all cells will have been detonated and will show a number, or will be flagged as a bomb.
